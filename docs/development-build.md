# DDS development ELFs

The `dds1-dev` and `dds2-dev` targets build separate executables whose layouts
can grow without weakening the byte-identical retail builds. Each target
recompiles and replaces the complete `.text` and `.rodata` sections of one
paired code unit, and links development-only C code and data into an appended
loadable segment:

```sh
ninja dds1-dev dds2-dev
```

The results are `build/dds1/SLUS_209.74.dev` and
`build/dds2/SLUS_211.52.dev`. The ordinary `dds1` and `dds2` targets are
unchanged and remain SHA-1 checked against retail.

## What the target verifies

The development link uses the complete object graph and retains the linker's
relocation records. `tools/dev_elf.py` then rejects the output unless all of
the following hold:

- the input executable has the expected retail SHA-1;
- each retired section leaves an exactly sized zero-filled retail slot;
- replacement section addresses and sizes come from linker boundary symbols,
  rather than fixed offsets in the descriptor;
- every nonempty global or weak `FUNC` or `OBJECT` definition in a replaced
  span has exactly one development definition with the same name, binding,
  type, visibility, and logical move, wholly contained in that move;
- every changed word outside the declared old slots, ELF metadata, and heap
  patches is explained by a relocation to the corresponding replacement
  symbol and addend;
- direct jumps, word-aligned absolute addresses, and common MIPS address
  constructions do not still refer to the abandoned slot;
- the appended `PT_LOAD` does not overlap an existing segment and fits in an
  unused program-header slot;
- the development heap begins after the appended segment while the retail BSS
  clear boundary remains unchanged;
- each moved section contains the exact expected number of relocation entries
  at sites within its span (21 for replacement text and 10 for read-only data
  in each current build);
- every allocated replacement-object section is explicitly moved or retained;
  currently retained data and BSS sections must remain empty;
- each development-only addition occupies its linker-derived span and retains
  its expected number of relocation entries; and
- each static linker redirect starts at its asserted retail target and resolves
  to its named wrapper inside the development segment.

Each `replacements` entry substitutes a separately compiled object for the
object named by its `retail_object`; its moved sections are declared in
`moves`, while `retained_sections` accounts for allocated sections that stay
at their retail placements. The current policy requires every retained section
to have size zero.

The descriptors for the current moves and their asserted binary sites are
`config/dds1/devbuild.json` and `config/dds2/devbuild.json`. The checks
intentionally fail closed when either retail layout or relocation closure
changes.

## Development entry hook

Each `src/dds*/dev/devbuild.c` is compiled only for its corresponding
development target, with small-data addressing disabled so it does not consume
the retail `$gp` window. Each link uses `--wrap` to redirect the single startup
call through a version-specific wrapper:

| Version | Original | Wrapper |
|---|---|---|
| DDS1 | `func_00101BD8` | `__wrap_func_00101BD8` |
| DDS2 | `func_00101AC0` | `__wrap_func_00101AC0` |

The wrapper increments `devBuildState.entryCount`, then passes the original
arguments and return value through unchanged.

The appended segment also exposes `devBuildIdentifier` and an initialized
`devBuildState.magic` marker. Together these provide concrete code, read-only
data, writable data, and an execution path for development additions without
placing any of them in the retail link.

## Current scope

These are relocatable development builds, not general mod loaders. Each
version replaces one paired unit's code and both of its jump tables, then
links one development entry object. The replacement is compiled separately
with `-G0`: its `.text` is `0x3D0` bytes rather than the retail `0x3C8`, so two
later function definitions move by eight bytes. Seven incoming references per
game are verified against those shifted definitions by symbol identity and
addend; a same-offset range mapping would point them at the wrong code.

Replacement-owned code and read-only data may change size and contents. New
allocated data, small-data, or BSS sections are rejected until their
initialization and lifetime rules are modeled. Extending the replacement set
is therefore a deliberate per-object operation with a fail-closed link audit,
not a claim that arbitrary assembly, DMA data, or physical-address payloads
are already movable. Emulator and hardware execution remain an independent
validation step rather than a requirement for the static build capability.
